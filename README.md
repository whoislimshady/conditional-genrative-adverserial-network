# Conditional-genrative-adverserial-network
In GAN, there is no control over modes of the data to be generated. The conditional GAN changes that by adding the label y as an additional parameter to the generator and hopes that the corresponding images are generated. We also add the labels to the discriminator input to distinguish real images better.
